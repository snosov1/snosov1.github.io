      <title>&#34;OpenCV on Jetson&#34; Screencasts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A significant part of my life is connected with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://opencv.org/&#34; title=&#34;OpenCV&#34;&gt;OpenCV&lt;/a&gt; library. It has a
fairly interesting history that, probably, deserves a thin printed brochure of
its own: born in Intel, then &#34;abandoned&#34; to a third-party company to become
world&#39;s largest Computer Vision library, then &#34;bought&#34; by Intel again with
Itseez acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to name the single reason which made the library a success, but
all-in-all, it was a rock-solid software library that was at the edge of the
technology. Both in terms of its main application - Computer Vision - and in
terms of software development, in general (it was an early adopter of CMake,
git, CUDA, vector intrinsics, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A skeptic, can, probably, say that if you count the number of tech businesses
fueled by OpenCV, the library didn&#39;t provide stellar results. But the use of
Computer Vision in the industry even today (not to mention 10-15 years ago) is
still rather limited. And one thing that&#39;s hard to deny is the influence of
OpenCV on the area as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
